The purpose of this project is to identify global life expectancy and health metrics to uncover trends, correlations, and disparities across countries.

Select --This was to check what was the lowest and highest life expectancy for each country for the past 15 years from 2007 to 2022.

Select -- After check the last step, This was used to identify the countries that does not have a 0 value in the min and max life expectancy as it may be a data quality issue for countries with a 0 value.

select --This was used to calculate if the life expectancy has increased or decreased in each country from 2007 to 2022 by subtracting the maximum and minimum life expectancy.

from world_life_expectancy
group by country
having min(cast (life_expectancy as numeric)) <> 0 
and max(cast (life_expectancy as numeric)) <> 0
order by country desc;

select --this was used to calculate the average life expectancy for all countries combined in each year. To make the calculation more accurate/realistic, countries that had a 0 value in the min or max life expectancy were filtered out.

select --this was used to identify if there is a positive or negative correlation between GDP and life_expectancy for each country per year. Generally, if a GDP is high in a country, then their life expectancy is also high and vice versa if GDP was low in a country then their life expectancy is low.

select --this was used to calculate the average gdp and life_expectancy for each country to check if there's any correlations.

 , round(avg(gdp),1) as gdp

select --this was used to identify whether the zero values in life_expectancy and gdp is correct data or if it needs to be corrected.

 , round(avg(gdp),1) as gdp

select --after creating this output, it was found that there is a positive correlation between low gdp and low life_expectancy.

 , round(avg(gdp),1) as gdp
from world_life_expectancy
group by country
having avg(cast(life_expectancy as numeric)) > 0
and avg(gdp) > 0
order by gdp asc;

select --this query was used to test the opposite of the above's query, which is to see if there is a positive correlation between high gdp and high life expectancy. This output reveals the result of a high gdp per capita causes an increase in life expectancy by economic growth and development in a country.

 , round(avg(gdp),1) as gdp
from world_life_expectancy
group by country
having avg(cast(life_expectancy as numeric)) > 0
and avg(gdp) > 0
order by gdp desc;

select --this query was to count the number of countries with a high gdp/low gdp and identify their average life_expectancy. The value 1500 in the GDP section was used as the halfway point between the high and low GDP values.

sum(case when gdp >=1500 then 1 else 0 end) high_gdp_count,--the results show a certain amount of rows (countries) that have a GDP higher than 1500.

avg(case when gdp >=1500 then (cast(life_expectancy as numeric)) else null end) high_gdp_life_expectancy,--the results are based on the average life expectancy if GDP is greater than 1500. Null was used to filter out 0 values.

sum(case when gdp <=1500 then 1 else 0 end) low_gdp_count,--the results show a certain amount of rows (countries) that have a GDP lower than 1500.

avg(case when gdp <=1500 then (cast(life_expectancy as numeric)) else null end) low_gdp_life_expectancy--the results are based on the average life expectancy if GDP is lower than 1500. Null was used to filter out 0 values.

from world_life_expectancy;--the final results show a high correlation between a high GDP and high life expectancy and a low GDP and low life expectancy.

select --this query was to identify if there is a difference in how a country's status, whether that is developed or undeveloped, with a variety of factors can affect the civilian's life expectancy
status, 
round(avg(cast(life_expectancy as numeric)),1)
from world_life_expectancy
group by status;--the results show that there a very few countries that have low life expectancy compared to countries with a high life expectancy so the next query will be used to accurately count the number of developed and developing countries

select --this query was done to count the number of developed and undeveloped countries to further understand the difference of their average life expectancy between the two categories.
status
,count(distinct country) as count_of_each_country
,round(avg(cast(life_expectancy as numeric)),1) as avg_life_expectancy
from world_life_expectancy
group by status;--the results show the developed countries have a higher life expectancy than developing countries which is to be expected because it would be easier to keep that high average if there aren't too many developed countries.

select --this query is used to check the correlation between the average bmi and average life expectancy in each country. The 0 value was filtered out of the life expectancy and bmi columns to make the results more accurate.

,round(avg(bmi),1) as average_bmi 
from world_life_expectancy
where (cast(life_expectancy as numeric)) > 0 and bmi > 0
group by country
order by average_bmi desc;--the results show the developed countries that have a high bmi, also has a high life expectancy.

select --this query is used to check the correlation between the average bmi and average life expectancy in each country. The 0 value was filtered out of the life expectancy and bmi columns to make the results more accurate.

group by country
order by average_bmi asc;--the results show the developing countries that have a low bmi, also has a low life expectancy.

select--this is query is used to compare a country's adult mortality to their life expectancy. Rolling total is used to add the sum of adult mortality values year after year in a stuctured sequence for each country.
